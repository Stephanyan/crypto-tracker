# Cryptocurrency tracker

Just another cryptocurrency tracker app built with Ruby on Rails.
To get data, my app scraps the [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/) platform.

## Issue
 I put the link of the app in production that DOESN'T work... Désolé.

That's why I took a GIF as demo of my app, locally.

### Installation:

Requirement: you need an internet connection.

- clone this repository
- run `bundle install --without production`
- run `rails db:migrate`
- have some fun
